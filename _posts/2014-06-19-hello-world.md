How's it going!

I am Vijay Dev from India. I am UI/Front-end developer with 5 years of solid experience in web/mobile applications.

This site is my efforts to start writing a blog to share and interact my experiences with the internet. 

Now then, since its "Hello world", here is a very simple hello world program in JavaScript:

{% highlight js %}
// Create a variable to hold the message
var msg = 'Hello World!';

// log the message in console
console.log( msg );

// > Hello World!
{% endhighlight %}
